# WSQ-6_FactorialCalculator
This program basically asks the user for a non-negative value and then prints the factorial of it. Once itâ€™s done the program asks if you would like to know the factorial of another number. If the user selects yes, then the program repeats. 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std ;
int main () {

int num, times, factorial ;
char ans ;

  do {
    times = 1 ;
    factorial = 1 ;

    cout << "Choose a non-negative number please: " ;
    cin >> num ;

    //Formula
    while (times <= num) {
      factorial = factorial * times ;
      ++times ;
    }

    cout << "The factorial of " << num << " is " ;
    cout << factorial << endl ;
    cout << "Would you like to try another number? [y/n]" << endl ;
    cin >> ans ;


  } while (ans == 'y') ;

    cout << "Have a nice day!" << endl ;

return 0;
}
